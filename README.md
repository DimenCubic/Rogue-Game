# My Personal Project

## Introduction

### What will the application do
This application is a rogue-like game that allows you to control the character (a box) to fight against evil monsters. You can find many weapons along the journey and you can also learn some skills when you defeat strong monsters. Furthermore, you have a small room as your home where you can rest and decorate.

### Who will use it
Everyone who wants to have an enjoyable time.

### Why I interest in this project
Games are the ninth art. In reality, we are constrained by various principles. For example, as humans, we cannot fly without the help of equipment, cannot use magic in our daily life , and everything we create is equally bound by the laws of physics. However, in games, we can experience journeys that are impossible in the current real world â€” we can fight on *World War II* battlefields, feeling the brutality of war and the preciousness of life. We can rest in the tower of *Gryffindor*, witnessing one mesmerizing magic after another. We can leap from the towers of *Notre Dame in Paris*, experiencing the historical atmosphere of the French Revolution. We can also retrace the path that *Wukong* took to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures, appreciating the unique charm of Chinese culture.

In addition to giving us a tangible glimpse of things that exist in our imagination, games are also driving the *development of the computer field*. Nowadays, more and more games use cutting-edge technologies like motion capture and AI, pushing programmers to come up with more efficient and concise algorithms and graph theories, designing more diverse and enjoyable gameplay. Computers and games complement each other.

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would design several manager classes for the *Weapon* class to handle some of its functions. For instance, I would create a class named *WeaponGUIManager*, and the GUI classes that need to interact with the *Weapon* class would instead associate with this manager class, rather than building direct associations with the *Weapon* class.

The reason for this refactoring is that there are currently too many classes associated with the *Weapon* class, which makes it challenging to maintain. For example, if we need to modify something in the *Weapon* class, all related classes, including both model and GUI classes, would need to be updated, as they all rely on the *Weapon* class. By introducing several manager classes, we can reduce the coupling between the *Weapon* class and other parts of the system, thereby minimizing the amount of work required for future maintenance.
